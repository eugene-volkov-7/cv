    <h1>Eugene Volkov</h1>

    <p><em>Mechanical Engineer + Future <strong>Web Developer And Programmer</strong></em></p>
    <p>I have worked as a design engineer, test engineer and R&D engineer for around 8 years. Being an engineer had been an exciting and challenging career, however now I'm studying to become a web developer and a programmer, which is something I had done before as hobby. I also love nature and look forward to working remotely from my beautiful property located in the scenic mountains of upstate New York.</p>
